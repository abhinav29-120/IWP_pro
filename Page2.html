	<h3>What is Phishing?</h3>
		<p>
			Phishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames, passwords and credit card details, by disguising oneself as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to deceive users. Users are lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as social web sites, auction sites, banks, colleagues/executives, online payment processors or IT administrators.

			Phew! Now that is some seriously technical stuff to understand. So how do you know what exactly is phishing. Well, think of it this way, have you ever received any e-mail asking you to update your account credentials by a reputed organization like Amazon, Flipkart or a bank where you might be having an account, or have you received one of those texts saying that you have won a lottery or that to protect your account, you need to change the credentials of your account. This is exactly what the aforementioned text talks about.

			Such e-mails or texts tend to direct the user to a malicious website that might look legitimate but unfortunately is not one bit of what it looks like. This is where the user gets illuminized and reveals the credentials or other confidential information which is exactly what the attackers intended.
